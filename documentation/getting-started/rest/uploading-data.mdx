APIs can also be used to upload encoded content to a server. This is usually done with `PUT` or `POST` methods.

The most common content types are:

- `application/json`: for content in JSON format
- `multipart/form-data`: for uploading encoded files

## Uploading a File

Let's take a look at uploading an image file to an API using Hoppscotch.

To upload a file, the data you send in a `POST` request must be of the content types `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `multipart/form-data`.

### Uploading an Image

1. Select the `POST` HTTP method and set your API Endpoint URL.
2. Add the necessary headers.
3. In the body tab, select `multipart/form-data` in the content-type dropdown.
4. Provide a field name for your file and click on **Choose Files** to select your image.
5. Click **Send** to upload your file.

## Uploading JSON Data

To upload JSON content, Hoppscotch now supports JSON with comments (JSONC) and trailing commas. Before transmitting the data to the server, the JSON is parsed from JSONC, stripping out comments and any unnecessary commas.

### Steps to Upload JSON Data

1. Select the `POST` or `PUT` HTTP method and set your API Endpoint URL.
2. Add the necessary headers.
3. In the body tab, select `application/json` in the content-type dropdown.
4. Write your JSON payload. You can now include comments and trailing commas in your JSON for better clarity and maintainability.
    - Example:

    ```jsonc
    {
        // This is a comment
        "name": "example",
        "value": 42, // Trailing comma is now allowed
    }
    ```
5. Hoppscotch will parse the JSONC into valid JSON before sending it to the server.
6. Click **Send** to upload your JSON data.
